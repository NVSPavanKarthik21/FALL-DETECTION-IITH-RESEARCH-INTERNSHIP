# FALL-DETECTION-IITH-RESEARCH-INTERNSHIP

I worked on this problem statement during my IIT Hyderabad Research Internship. This is a computer vision project which helps in detection of falls of people from videos. It is coded in python and uses OpenCv library. At the end of the project, I could get the accuracy of the fall detection to 93.15%.
